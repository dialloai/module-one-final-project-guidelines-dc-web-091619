## Project Description
Auto-Park DC was created by Aicha Diallo Antonio Abraham. We have built this project using a Command Line database application. It is structured as a many to many relationship table. We have built four models: "Customer", "Neighborhood", "Parking Space", and "Reservation". A customer has access to many neighborhoods and parking spaces; neighborhoods and parking spaces are available to many customers. Parking spaces are accessed via neighborhoods. A customer is able to access a parking space via reservations, and a parking space has many customers via reservations. The reservations table we built is the join model in the structured data. We have created seed data that populates the information of the models.

## Usage
A customer is able to use the application by first inputing their name and creating a username. Thereafter, they are prompted to select the neighborhood they are looking for parking; the parking space populates as per their criteria. Upon their selection, customers view the spaces available and the command line asks if they would like to book their desired selection. If yes, they receive a confirmation of their booking, else, they are rerouted back to the main menu. Once a parking is booked, another user is not able to book that same location.
